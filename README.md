# multiMediaScripts
Small set of scripts to manage gmusicBrowser or Spotify

It allows to play/pause/skip or simply go back to the previous song.

It also allows to show a small metadata about what is currently being played on the system.

The idea is to define hot-keys against the scripts in order to invoke them.

My current confinguration is:

|Key|What|
|---|---|
|Super-U|gmusicBrowser|
|Ctrl-Super-U|spotify|
|Super-j|Next Song|
|Super-k|Previous Song|
|Super-i|Play/Pause|
|Super-o|Stop|
|Super-y|Show MetadaData|

You will need to "sudo apt install yad" to display the  metadata.
